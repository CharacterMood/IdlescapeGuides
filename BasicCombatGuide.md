## Combat Basics
In Idlescape there are three main ways to fight various enemies; Melee, Magic, and Ranged.
You can earn experience in these different styles of combat by hitting enemies with their related abilities.
To get more abilities to use, you can get them from either skill books or equiping certain items.
<br />

## Consumables
In combat you can use food, ammo, and runes as consumables to help you fight.
Food will increase survivability, while ammo will increase damage.
Runes are used mostly in magic for certain abilities, without them the skills wont be as potent.
<br />

## Abilities and Rotations
When you obtain abilities, you can slot them into a rotation, which will automatically execute in combat related activities.
You can do this by either dragging and dropping them into place, or clicking the abilities.
Abilities in the first slot will be prioritized when they are off cooldown compared to abilities in the last slot.
You can change your auto attack to be more specalized depending on your equipment. These abilities have no cooldown and are placed at the end of your rotation.
<br />

## Waves and Elites
When you defeat all enemies on the screen, it will start a new "wave".
After defeating 50 of these, you will go up in difficulty and the stats of the enemies will increase, but so will the loot rewards.
Around difficulty 4, you will start to see more Elite variants of enemies that are stronger and probably a different color.
The higher the difficulty, the more elite enemies you will see.
<br />

## Death and Respawning
When your HP hits zero, you will be "knocked out" and respawn after a minute or so in most areas.
When this happens, waves will reset and combat will start again.
When "knocked out" in elite scrolls, you will not respawn and will fail the scroll, so plan and prepare carefully.
In dungeons you will fail when everyone in your party is "knocked out".
To prevent this, you can bring good food or use certain abilities and enchantments to keep yourself healthy.
<br />

## Loadouts
You can assign equipment to a loadout and then assign that loadout to a specific zone.
When loadouts are assigned to a zone, it will automatically equip that loadout before entering the zone.
If it is unable to do so, it will give you an error and tell you what went wrong in either group or activity chat.
<br />

## Mercenaries
Mercenaries is a feature that can be used to create a "fake player" for either duoing zones or completeing dungeons.
However, they will require you to provide gear and food for them to use and it can't be gear you are using yourself, or have assigned to another merc.
These can be provided by using a loadout and setting it as an "active" mercenary. 
Mercenaries will consume all of the provide food in a loadout at once and add it to their HP pool.
Using Mercenaries has the downside of losing some of your junk drops and crippling loneliness, which increases with every merc you hire.
