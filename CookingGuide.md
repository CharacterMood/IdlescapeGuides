Cooking is a complex skill that requires a bit of experimenting with ingredients to get a solid
grasp on, however it is a very useful skill to help supply you with all your food and potion needs. In order
to start, you need to throw some ingredients into the cooking pot, such as one carrot and one shrimp in
order to make a dish/meal. The listed ingredients above will make a Kebab +0, which is a decent food option
starting out. The +0 comes from the size of ingredients added, which can be improved by adding more of the
same ingredients. You also get +1 for every 30 effective cooking levels.
<br />
You will also obtain one cooking shard for every 5 minutes spent cooking, which can be used towards The
Golden Spoon, the Legendary Cooking tool.

## Difficulty and Size
On each ingredient, there is a difficulty and size rating.
<br/>
Difficulty is how complex a dish is made by
adding it to the pot, which in turn makes the success rate lower and the time to cook higher. The higher
your effective level, the more complex dishes one can make.
<br/>
Size is the amount of the ingredient, such as three Vegetables for a Pumpkin or Two Meat and Fish for a Raw Trout. These play a
hand in recipes such as the Kebab mentioned above which requires at least one Veggie and one Meat to create.
You can make a stronger level of Kebabs by doing 1x Pumpkin and 1x Raw Tuna which would come out as a higher
quality. Another Decent but advanced food is 1x Raw Beef, Raw Chicken and Raw Trout which would create a Meat
Roast. These are just some examples, there are many other recipes that can be found with some
experimentation or asking some fellow players.
<br/>
Fish oil can be obtained by cooking fish, with each fish giving a fixed percentage to give an oil. 
Fish oil can also be used in cooking to decrease the size of a dish/meal, making it take less time to cook.
You can use more then one fish oil to speed it up further, however this will be costly.

## Alchemy itemIcon(itemsIds.empty_large_vial)
While meals are mainly for healing in combat, Alchemy is mainly for Buffs. Some ingredients have certain
buffs on them, such as Inferno on pepper. These can be made into potions, which disregard the Type of an
Ingredient. They instead use Alchemy Size and Normal Size in its creation. Additional to make a potion, one
will need a vial which can be crafted using some sand and heat, then the targeted buff item, then you can
increase the amount of stacks the potion will give, as well as how potent it is by adding more Alchemy Size
to it, however it will become increasingly more difficult to create a potion the more complex it is.

<p>
	A useful tool for cooking is a Ladle, which can be obtained from Goblins in Combat. There are few different
	types of base ladles, but they are the same, the searing ladle being an exception which is earned from the
	Goblin Settlement Dungeon. When augmented, theyâ€™ll increase your effective cooking level as well as give you
	a few hidden levels of haste when equipped. These can be enchanted with some useful enchantments, such as
	Master Chef to help you with your cooking.

<p>A Chefs Hat, obtained from the Goblin Settlement Dungeon, comes with three Enchantment Slots and will increase your effective cooking level when Augmented.</p>
