Cooking is a very useful and helpful skill as it supplies combat with food for healing and skills with buff 
potions with Alchemy. In order to get started with cooking, one must first prepare the ingredients for the
various recipes within the game. To prepare ingredients and essence, click on the items in the preparation tab
to select it for prep, then click start. You will then use the item to prepare it into its raw ingredients and 
essence if it gives any.
Once you have obtained the ingredients/essence for said recipes and potions, they will automatically unlock.
<br />
Each 30 levels in your effective cooking level will give you +1 to your base recipe level.
<br />
You will also obtain one cooking shard for every 5 minutes spent cooking, which can be used towards the
Golden Spoon, the Legendary Cooking tool and the Cooking set.

## Difficulty and Size
On each ingredient, there is a difficulty, size rating, and alchemy size.
<br/>
Difficulty is how hard it is to make a certain recipe/potion based upon the ingredients it has. It also increases the amount of experience
earned multiplied by 5. 
<br/>
Size is how much raw ingredients for that tag you will get from preparing the various cooking items in the game. An example would be a tomato 
having a size of three, thusly giving you three of each of raw veggies and fruits as well as one sour essence due to its one alchemy size.
<br/>
Fish oil can be obtained by preparing fish, with each fish having a fixed percentage to give an oil.

## Cooking
Cooking will have a list of various recipes that you can make if you have the ingredients for them, if this tab is empty, then you need to prepare some
ingredients to unlock them first. To get started, click on the dish you wish to create and it will give you a list of ingredients you need to create it 
on the right. You can increase the strength of the dish by increasing the slider, but this will require more ingredients as well as increase the dish difficulty.
Additionally, you can add certain items to a dish to give it a combat related buff, such as Ichor for Demon Skin for damage reduction.

Alchemy can be used to create potions with various buffs to help with the skills in the game. To create a potion, click on the buff you wish to create
then select the size of the potion in the first box on the right side of the interface using one of the three vial types. Additionally to this, you can 
upgrade potions you've already created into highier and stronger buffs at the cost of more ingredients and essence.
