Achievements are fun little goals you can aim for within the game to complete, some of which will reward you
with talents as well! There will be a few that you can do after you completed the tutorials, but others will
only be unlocked once you complete the associated quest/requirement they need. Note that if an achievement
is locked and you do something that would count towards that achievement, it won&apos;t count until its
unlocked.
<br />
Completing achievements will earn you points, which after getting a certain amount, will earn you a talent
point you can use. (Basically every {ACHIEVEMENT_TO_TALENT_POINTS} achievement points is one talent point.)
