Achievements are fun little goals you can aim for within the game to complete, some of which will reward you with talents as well! There will be a few that you can do from the get-go, but the ones that are locked will only be unlocked once you complete the associated quest/requirement they need.
Note that if an achievement is locked and you do something that would count towards that achievement, it wont count till its unlocked.
<br />
Completeing achievements will earn you points, which after getting a certain amount, will earn you a talent point you can use. 
(Basically every 10 achievement points is one talent point.)
