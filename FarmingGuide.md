Farming is a passive skill where you can plant seeds obtained from Foraging into a field and they'll
automatically harvest and replant till you either stop it or run out of seeds. Each seed has a farming level
requirement as well as a size requirement in order for it to plant. Starting out, your field will be small
and you won't be able to plant much, but every 10 farming levels, your farm will expand alternating by 1 row
vertically and horizontally up to level 90, afterwards it'll expand one row horizontally at the bottom every
10 mastery levels. Your effective farming level will increase the minimal yield of seeds.
<br />
Start by selecting a seed and then clicking on the plot to plant it. You can drag to plant multiple seeds at
once. This also allows you to select multiple plants at once to change their settings.

## Fertilizer itemIcon(itemsIds.fertilizer)
Fertilizer is an optional item that will increase the minimal yield of your crops as well as increase the
experience earned from them. It costs one fertilizer per tile the seed uses, so a 2x2 seed will consume four
Fertilizer per cycle.

## Farming Shards itemIcon(itemsIds.farming_shard)
With a full plot, you'll gain a farming shard every five minutes, no matter what is planted. This time is
delayed with every empty plot spot you have, an example being if you have half of your field planted, you'll
obtain a shard every ten minutes. The farming shards can be used to craft the legendary elven hoe.

## Mysterious Seeds itemIcon(itemsIds.mysterious_seed)
Mysterious Seeds are special seeds that can be obtained via other plants and combat from time to time, can
be planted up to 4x4 size, and give a variety of items from a special loot table. You will need one seed per
tile. Bigger plants will yield more loot, but the experience per invested seed decreases as every size gives
the same experience.

## Totems itemIcon(itemsIds.water_totem), itemIcon(itemsIds.nature_totem),itemIcon(itemsIds.earth_totem), itemIcon(itemsIds.coalescing_totem),
There are four special totems you can use to enhance your idle farming experience. Each one lasts a full
week, growing stronger the farther longer they are in their growth.
<ul>
	<li>Water Totems increase growth stages, meaning faster crop growth</li>
	<li>Nature Totems have a chance to give you a free replant of a crop.</li>
	<li>Earth Totems increase crop Yields up to 50% depending on the growth stage.</li>
	<li>
		Coalescing Totems do what the other totems do (Stacking with them as well), as well as reduce
		fertilizer costs. But to get their full effect, you need to plant different seeds on your plot
		(Different mysterious seeds count as different seeds for this).
	</li>
</ul>

## TrapsitemIcon(itemsIds.box_trap)
You can craft
different kinds of traps using logs from Foraging. These traps can be used to collect some useful items used
in crafting Ranged Equipment, such as Scales, Chiten, and furs/hides to make leather. Different traps are
better for different loot.
