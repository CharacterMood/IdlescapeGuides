# IdlescapeGuides
This is the community driven repository for the ingame guides of [Idlescape](https://idlescape.com/). Everyone is welcome to contribute even if you are not a developer. Just follow the steps below.

## How to contribute
First of all if you really don't want to interact with git (it's easy, trust me), you can always contribute through the [official Idlescape discord](https://idlescape.com/discord). Just post in #in-game-guides and someone else will integrate the changes for you.

If you want to contribute directly, follow these steps:
1. Get a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. It's free!
    1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page.
2. Get an editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the one we recommend. You can also use Notepad if you don't want to install one, but a proper editor makes things easier for you.
3. Get a git tool: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is the one we recommend for beginners.
    1. In GitHub Desktop login with your GitHub account.
    2. Click "Clone a repository from the Internet..."
    3. Under "Github.com" search for "IdlescapeGuides", choose a local directory if you want and then click "Clone". This will download the repository to your computer.
4. Now open the repository in your editor and make all the changes you want. Each guide has its own file.
5. Once you are done, go back to GitHub Desktop and you will see the changes you made. Doesn't hurt to double check for any mistakes.
    1. Summarize your changes in the "Summary" field.
    2. Click "Commit to main".
    3. Click "Push origin" to upload your changes to your forked repository.
6. Go back to the original repository (this page if you're reading this for the first time). You should now see a "Contribute" button (You might need to refresh). Click it and create a "Pull request".
7. Done! Your changes will be reviewed and integrated into the game. Thank you for contributing!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask either in the discord or ingame.
