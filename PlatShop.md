Platinum (Plat) can be purchased with real life money in order to obtain global player buffs, quality of life tokens, and cosmetic items. 
<br />
Global player buffs will apply to the entire server for others to enjoy, as well as a special thank you in general chat when purchased. You can opt out of displaying your name by clicking "Anonymous Purchase". 20 Plat is equal to one minute of buff time. Buffs will start at level 2 and upgrade to Level 3 at 1 day, Level 4 at 1 week. Once the threshold is reached, the buff stays at that level including later extensions by different players or yourself.

Tokens can be purchases to do a variety of things, such as increasing Loadout slots, changing your name, your item names, and other helpful things. Each token will be placed into your stockpile upon purchase before they can be used.

Cosmetic  items are items that can be applied over in game items to change how your character or weapons look within the game. This will apply upon your inspect screen and in combat screens. Fashionscape starts here.
