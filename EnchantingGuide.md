Enchanting comes with four different uses: Scrollcrafting, Augmenting, Researching, and Enchanting, which can be
switched between at any time using the tabs. Scrollcrafting and Enchanting go hand in hand together while
Augmenting is how you increase the power of items, while Researching can create Runic Dusts and Scraps for affixing.

Your effective enchanting level can be increased by crafting a Lesser Magic Tome. This tome can be 
upgrade by augging it to a certain level, transforming into the next tier, capping out at the Ancient Magic Tome. 
The Lesser MAgic Tome can be found in the crafting skill.

	Scrollcrafting

Scrollcrafting allows you to create enchanted scrolls, which you can then put on your gear. Each enchanted
scroll requires one Scroll, Silver from Mining, and a variety of Runes from Runecrafting.
You can filter what type of enchantments you want by clicking on the gear filters at the top.
Please note that Enchants do not stack across gear. (Infero 5 on boots and Inferno 4 on gloves wont add up to 9, but will default 
to the highest enchanted one, which is 5.) 

## Enchanting
After you've made some scrolls, this is where you'd go to apply them on the applicable gear. Gear can only
hold so many enchantments, as denoted by the circle enchantment slots on any given item (if it has any).
Starting gear can usually only hold one enchantment while late game gear can have anywhere from six to
eight. You can overwrite enchantments in items with a different one. You can disenchant an enchanted item by
clicking on it and clicking "Disenchant". This will refund some of the materials in the process.

## Augmenting
Augmenting can increase the power of your equipment at the cost of resources. When augmenting any gear, you'll
slowly increase an augment counter, that when maxed out, will increase the equipments level by +1 and then reset with a higher requirement.
While augmenting you can get a Critical proc which will increase the count by 2 instead of 1, but only be the cost of one attempt.
During augmenting at certain levels, the first one being 5, you'll require an amount of the base item in order to increase the level of your gear.

## Researching
Researching is a new mechanic that will research the choosen item and procude Runic Dusts and Scraps at the cost of some resources.
Successful researches on an item will procude Runic Dust at the same rarity that the item is being researched, while failures will destroy the item and create scrap.
Additionally, some items may transform while they are being researched, which can be boosted with the "Chances" enchantment.
