Enchanting comes with four different uses: Scrollcrafting, Augmenting, Researching, and Enchanting, which can be
switched between at any time using the tabs. Scrollcrafting and Enchanting go hand in hand together while
Augmenting is how you increase the power of items, while Researching can create Runic Dusts and Scrap for affixing.

Your effective enchanting level can be increased by crafting Magic Tomes. They come in different tiers and
each tier consumes the previous tier during crafting. Check out the Skilling Tab in Crafting to find
their required resources.

	Scrollcrafting

Scrollcrafting allows you to create enchanted scrolls, which you can then put on your gear. Each enchanted
scroll requires one Scroll, Silver from Mining, and a variety of Runes from Runecrafting. Each scroll has a
success chance, which can be increased by increasing your Enchanting level. Upon failure to make a scroll,
you will lose any resources used in the attempt. You can filter what type of enchantments you want by
clicking on the gear filters at the top.

## Enchanting
After you've made some scrolls, this is where you'd go to apply them on your applicable gear. Gear can only
hold so many enchantments, as denoted by the circle enchantment slots on any given item (if it has any).
Starting gear can usually only hold one enchantment while late game gear can have anywhere from six to
eight. You can overwrite enchantments in items with a different one. You can disenchant an enchanted item by
clicking on it and clicking "Disenchant".

## Augmenting
Augmenting can increase the power of your equipment at the cost of resources. When augmenting any gear, you'll
slowly increase an augment counter, that when maxed out, will increase the equipments level by +1 and then reset with a higher requirement. 
While augmenting you can get a Critical proc which will increase the count by 2 instead of 1, but only be the cost of one attempt.
During augmenting at certain levels, you'll require an amount of the base item in order to increase the level of your gear.

## Researching
Researching is a new mechanic that will research the choosen item and procude Runic Dusts and Scraps at the cost of some resources.
Successful researches on an item will procude Runic Dust at the same rarity that the item is being researched, while failures will destroy the item and create scrap.
High level augmented gear will produce more Runic Dust and Scrap than base gear.

## Soulbinding
Soulbinding has been removed from the game, any soulbound gear you have will keep its augmented level and become tradable again.
